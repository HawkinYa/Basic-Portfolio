            Hello everyone! My name is Hunter Storm Hawk. Im not kidding, and I wouldn't change it for the world. I'm
            23 years old and I'm a full time
            student at The University of Arizona, looking to be certified as a Full Stack Technician and Front-End
            Website Developer. I have big goals of becoming very successful and to become
            a positive advocate for tattooed individuals in a professional environment.
        </p>

        <p id="p2">
            I have a passion for creativity and individualism that I'd like to spread around the world so that everyone
            can find the happiness that I
            have growing up. I enjoy traveling and meeting like-minded people who share as strong of a passion for
            success as I have.
        </p>

        <p id="p3">
            Anyone wanna join me?!
        </p>

<!-- i still have to figure out how exactly to get the
    css to line up the "about, contact, portfolio" tags to
    line up in container 1 along side my name. i cant get past
    how i cant use "display:inline and float: in the same string.."
