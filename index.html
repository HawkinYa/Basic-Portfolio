                    Hello everyone! My name is Hunter Storm Hawk. Im not kidding, and I wouldn't change it for the world. I'm 23 years old and I'm a full time 
                    student at The University of Arizona, looking to be certified as a Full Stack Technician and Front-End Website Developer. I have big goals of becoming very successful and to become
                    a positive advocate for tattooed individuals in a professional environment. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>   
                    I have a passion for creativity and individualism that I'd like to spread around the world so that everyone can find the happiness that I
                    have growing up. I enjoy traveling and meeting like-minded people who share as strong of a passion for success as I have.
                </p>
                    
                <p>   
                    Anyone wanna join me?!
                </p>
